# Fluid Camera

This is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app that uses the webcam and [Tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/) to track customizable colors and uses them to control a modified version of [WebGL-Fluid-Simulation](https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/) (this repo is actually forked from it).  It works best in the dark with glow sticks, LEDs or lit balloons.
